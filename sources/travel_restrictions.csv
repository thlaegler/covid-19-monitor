All travellers should obtain a medical certificate proving that they are clear of COVID-19 prior to travel to Zimbabwe; there is potential, based on a passenger’s nationality and recent travel history, that they may be asked at immigration to produce such a certificate in order to be granted entry.

Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy.

Wuhan ends COVID-19 lockdown as restrictions introduced in northern province of Heilongjiang . (Reuters, 08.04.2020)

Outside Hubei, railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Most areas have started to resume domestic passenger flights, trains, buses, ferries and city transportation.Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements.
Domestic travellers who plan to stay in hotels in major cities are not subject to mandatory quarantine, but must comply with the local requirements of information registration and body temperature monitoring. For those who have residence in the destination city, they must confirm with the local residence committee about quarantine requirements as these still vary across the country. Beijing still requires all residents returning from other provinces to be quarantined at home for 14 days, and from 12 April, all incoming travellers who stay in hotels should provide a nucleic acid test certificate. Various cities and provinces also require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Beijing, Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages companies to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak.
