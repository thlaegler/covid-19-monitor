The HSE rules include not going to work or to public places; not taking public transport or taxis; and not inviting visitors to your home. 
The arrival of personal non-national maritime leisure vessels is banned (except to exceptions as 'port in a storm').

On 8 June, Ireland moved to Phase 2 of a roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions. Travel is allowed  within counties for up to 20 kilometres from your home. Travel is allowed beyond under the following conditions: to travel to and from work, if your work cannot be carried out from home; to shop for essential food and household goods; to attend medical appointments and collect medicines; for vital family reasons, such as providing care to children, elderly or vulnerable people - but excluding social family visits; to escape domestic violence. Social distancing should be maintained at all times.
Up to 6 people who are not from the same household may also visit another household indoors. These visits should be kept as short as possible and last no more than an hour. Indoor visits should be in well-ventilated rooms where possible and everyone should practise good hand hygiene by washing their hands or using hand sanitiser. Social distancing should be maintained with all people keeping 2 metres apart. 
Groups of up to 6 people who are not from the same household can meet outdoors. This can include a family meeting an individual friend or neighbour, a group of individuals meeting outdoors, and three couples meeting outdoors. 
You may practice sport or fitness activities in groups of up to 15 outdoors but you must practice social distancing, minimise contact, not share equipment and practise strict hygiene. Activities involving children should involve no more than 12 children to allow for 3 supervisors to be present to oversee the activity and make sure that public health guidance is being followed. Over 70s and those extremely medically vulnerable to Covid-19 (“cocooning”). Up to 6 people may visit the home of those cocooning for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing, observation of hand hygiene practices, and where feasible in well-ventilated spaces. Outdoor visits are encouraged where possible. This public health advice also applies for those cocooning when visiting other households. As those who are cocooning begin to meet with increased numbers of people, they may wish to consider meeting with the same group of family or friends to reduce the risk of infection. An approach for those cocooning may be to identify a core small group of particular friends and family as regular visitors. The risk of spread of disease is higher when people meet changing groups of people.
Anyone who can work from home should continue to do so. There will be a phased return to work for solitary workers and other workers who, due to the nature of their work, can maintain a constant distance of 2 metres from other people.
