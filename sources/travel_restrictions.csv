Exemptions can be made for diplomatic flights, and private aircraft are allowed to operate domestically between Islamabad (ISB), Karachi (KHI), and Lahore (LHE) International Airports.
Foreigners with valid visas in Pakistan can have their visas extended until 30 June.
The Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on National Security clarified in a press conference that there is no prohibition on outgoing passengers from Pakistan on non-PIA flights but since no carrier would be flying in, it is automatically understood that outbound traffic would be halted as well.
All international arrivals are required to provide a medical certificate stating the results of the COVID-19 test conducted 24 hours prior to boarding the flights. This will be requested at the point of disembarkation in Pakistan.
All travellers are required to submit a health declaration form and undergo health screening upon arrival.
Upon arrival in Pakistan all travellers will be subject to a minimum of 48 hour state-monitored quarantine. Travellers are required to take a COVID-19 test after 48 hours and the quarantine period can then be extended based on the results.

If travellers choose to stay in a hotel or paid facility for their quarantine period they will be responsible for covering all expenses during this time.
All land borders remain closed.

Internal restrictions:
Government plans to extend state of emergency until end of June (Reuters, 16.05.2020). This gives the government emergency powers to impose limitations on movement and impose other extraordinary measures. Countrywide restrictions on movement remain in force and residents have been asked to remain at home except to go to work, to buy food, medicines and other essentials, or in the event of emergencies. However infants under the age of 14 allowed out for one hour. The wearing of face masks on public transport was made compulsory from 4 May. Hotels and short-stay accommodation (such as short-stay campsites or caravan parks) are closed. The measures do not apply to long-term accommodation, such as long-stay campsites, as long as travellers can cater for themselves and do not rely on communal facilities, which will be closed.

Relaxation of restrictions
The gradual relaxation of restrictions began from 4 May, starting with lifting minor restrictions on internal movement. The government is planning to start gradually easing the restrictions as follows. Each autonomous regional government will be able to modify restrictions depending on local realities and all dates remain approximate depending on the evolution of sanitary context. From 4 May, phase 0: appointment based services were allowed to reopen such as hairdressers, dentists, beauty parlours. In the Canary and Balearic islands, phase 1 will start on 4 May unlike the rest of the country (mainland) - see below. From 11 May, phase 1: bars, terraces and restaurants will be able to reopen only to a third of their capacity in selected areas. Bookstores and museums will be allowed to operate to 40% of their capacity. Family members will be allowed to attend funerals. Small gatherings will be allowed for ‘healthy individuals, with no vulnerabilities and no underlying conditions’. Hotels may reopen past this time, with a limited guest number of a third of their capacity and without the use of common spaces. Religious places may also reopen under the same restrictions. Territories authorised to proceed in phase 1 are listed on the Ministry of Health website. From 25 May, phase 2, theatres, cinemas and other cultural locations will be open to a third of their capacity. Weddings may include family members and friends past this phase but no further details are available as of yet. From 8 June, phase 3, food and beverage commerce may open to 50% of their capacity and travel within one’s region of accommodation. Some restrictions have already been lifted for some non-essential workers who are not able to work from home (e.g. the construction sector), while some factories have also been permitted to resume operations.
The authorities continue to recommend that citizens respect social distancing measures and wear face masks. Further details will be made available closer to those dates. Inter-regional travel may be relaxed from 22 June. Universities will remain closed until September. Schools will reopen gradually, with some exceptions to accommodate small children of essential workers.

International restrictions:
All international air traffic remains suspended until further notice; the ban also applies to transit flights via Abu Dhabi and Dubai. However, UAE-based air carriers are operating a limited number of inbound and outbound flights mainly to repatriate UAE nationals and foreign residents.
National carrier Etihad Airways will resume a limited number of inbound flights to Abu Dhabi from 9 May exclusively for UAE citizens and foreign nationals holding valid UAE residency permits. Travellers must apply for an ICA approval number via the UAE Twajudi Resident service, which can be accessed on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before booking their tickets. This unique number will allow travellers to make bookings exclusively through Etihad’s contact centre. All arriving passengers will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Entry restrictions
The authorities implemented entry restrictions for non-UAE citizens, including foreign nationals holding valid residency visas who were currently out of the country and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) citizens. While local media reports indicate that some exceptions have been made on a case-by-case basis since the restrictions came into effect, the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has requested such individuals to take the following steps:
Travellers who are currently in their country of origin should contact the UAE diplomatic mission in their respective country for the required support and to streamline their return back to the UAE.
Travellers who are currently outside the UAE for business should contact their employers in the UAE, as well as the UAE diplomatic mission in their host countries for the required support and to facilitate their return back to the UAE.
Travellers who are on vacation should contact the UAE diplomatic mission in their host countries, for the required support to facilitate their return back to the UAE.
Officials at Abu Dhabi airport have said that all flights are operating via the facility's Terminal 1 until further notice.

Flight suspensions
Dubai-based airline Emirates will operate outbound flights to London Heathrow (United Kingdom), Frankfurt (Germany), Paris (France), Milan (Italy), Madrid (Spain), Chicago (United States of America), Toronto (Canada), Sydney and Melbourne (Australia) from 21 May.
The Dubai-based carrier FlyDubai and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways have also suspended or modified routes to and from UAE airports.

Other measures
Individuals are required to wear masks and observe social distancing when in public. Infractions are punishable via legal action.
Officials had earlier closed beaches, cinemas, public parks and swimming pools until further notice - this remains in place.

In the Dubai emirate, a 24 hour remain-at-home directive has been rescinded. Since 24 April, this has now been relaxed to coincide with Ramadan - residents are now permitted to conduct movement between 06.00 and 22.00 without a permit; restrictions on movement between 22.00 and 06.00 remain in force and the only exceptions are for medical emergencies. Some metro service is due to recommence from 29 April. Restaurants, shopping malls and other retail outlets are allowed to open between 06.00 and 22.00.
Other emirates seemingly remain under the initial 20.00 to 06.00 curfew regime, including Abu Dhabi. Trips to purchase food and medication and essential workers are exempt. In Abu Dhabi a movement permit is required to travel during the sterilisation hours (individuals can apply here).
However, the above timing will change from 20 May, when the timing for the national sterilisation programme will change to 20.00-06.00, during which all individuals are required to stay indoor. The opening hours of shopping malls and retail shops will be 09.00-19.00.

The red level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed within the last 14 days. Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Karakalpakstan, Namangan, Samarkand, Sirdarya and Tashkent (excluding Tashkent city) regions have been designated as red zones. In these regions, existing quarantine measures remain in place, including internal movement restrictions mandating that all residents stay home, except for essential purposes or for work. Only essential and approved businesses are allowed to operate, including pharmacies, grocery shops, banks, dry cleaners and notaries. People are allowed to walk near their homes, provided they maintain social distancing and wear masks. Driving is allowed from 18 May with a permit sticker from 07.00 to 10.00 (local time) and from 17.00 to 20.00 for essential shopping or work.

As of 15 May, sectors including handicraft, maintenance of agricultural machinery and electronic appliance, rent and lease, and accounting, auditing as well as tax consulting have been allowed to operate.
The yellow level applies to regions where COVID-19 cases have not been confirmed within the last 14 days, but where COVID-19 patients are undergoing treatment. This category includes Tashkent, as well as Khorezm and Surkhandarya regions. The same movement restrictions under the red quarantine level apply.

From 15 May, open-air stadiums and museums are allowed to reopen with a limited number of visitors.

Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy.

Many local governments require inbound travellers to inform their local company office and neighbourhood committee in advance about their travel plan.
The number of international passenger flights is reduced. In Beijing, international flights are not landing directly at Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK), but are diverted first to other domestic airports in Dalian, Hohhot, Jinan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Shanghai Pudong, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Xi’an and Zhengzhou for screening. Travellers will have to undergo a 14-day quarantine at a designated facility upon entry. After clearing the 14-day quarantine, if the traveller enters Beijing after the second day the traveller clears the quarantine, the traveller will have to undergo another 14-day quarantine either at home or a designated facility for 14 additional days.
All land border crossings between China and Russia have been closed to travellers. Yunnan province has banned citizens from leaving the country by more than 30 land and river ports at the province’s borders with Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.
The Chinese Government is in discussions with foreign governments on ""fast-track"" procedures to allow key employees of foreign companies to return to China. So far, ""fast-track"" commercial charter flights have been arranged with Germany and South Korea and may be extended to other countries in the future.
All transit/transfer services, including air transit/transfer, cross boundary land transport and cross boundary ferry transfer, are suspended for all passengers at Hong Kong International Airport.
Residents with travel history in Daegu and Gyeongsangbuk-do in South Korea, Iran, as well as Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy in the past 14 days will be required upon entry to stay in a quarantine centre for 14 days. Residents with travel history in any other overseas locations in the preceding 14 days will be subject to a 14-day mandatory quarantine.

Internal restrictions:
Mainland China: Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
Beijing: On 29 April, the Beijing government announced a new policy that business travellers and returnees who come from domestic ‘COVID-19 low risk’ areas to Beijing will NOT need the 14 days of home quarantine. People who have travelled from low risk areas to Beijing and are currently under home quarantine can halt their home quarantine and medical observation if applicable. The new Beijing policy does not apply to travellers from overseas, Hubei province or other domestic ‘medium and high risk areas’. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.
As the situation continues to improve across the country, almost all the cities and provinces have declared the local risk level to be low. The latest city is Suifenhe, the border city with Russia in Heilongjiang province, who adjusted its risk level to low from May 6. However, some cities also chose to strengthen their quarantine measures due to re-emergence of local or imported cases. On 10 May, Shulan (Jilin province) raised its risk level to ‘high’ due to new local cases, and has re-strengthened restrictions on local movement and public gathering. Several train routes to/from Shulan have also been suspended.All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. (The Guardian, 19.05.2020) 

Another example is Taiyuan (who did so on 3 May), Shanxi provincial capital, although it didn’t announce any change to its risk or response level. In Shanghai and Guangdong, public health emergency response levels have been changed from level II to level III.
A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip. Heilongjiang announced an ‘in-city code’ in addition to the three-colour health code. Personnel with ‘in-city code’ are restricted to travel out of their current city but can move freely inside.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
On 13 May, Jilin city was announced to be ‘sealed’. Transportations services such as intercity buses and trains for Jilin city are suspended now. People who want to move out of the city need the nucleic acid test within 48 hours of travel and register the information according to official instructions.",2020-05-19 00:00:00.000000,"All travelers, who enter China will be screened upon arrival and be subject to a 14-day quarantine.

Internal restrictions:  A nationwide state of emergency (SoE) has been extended to 31 May. Meanwhile, the government on 14 May lifted the SoE in 39 out of 47 prefectures.
The SoE remains in place in the following prefectures: the capital Tokyo,
Chiba (all Kanto region), Hokkaido (Hokkaido region), Hyogo (all Kansai region), Kanagawa, Kyoto, Osaka and Saitama. Earlier, these prefectures were declared ‘special alert’ areas, where measures to contain the pandemic are focused. The measures include school closures and strongly promoting working from home or staggering commuting hours.
Under SoE, respective governors are allowed to order the closures of facilities such as schools, cinemas, departments stores as well as ban the gathering of large crowds. Essential services, such as medical facilities, pharmacies, supermarkets, convenience stores, factories, public bathhouses and restaurants, will continue to operate.
The authorities on 4 May announced gradual easing of restrictions on social and economic activities in prefectures not on ‘special alert’. Some businesses, such as restaurants and department stores that were temporarily closed resumed operations by taking social distancing measures and operating in shorter hours. Public transport such as busses, trains and taxis continue to operate, though a reduction in services can be expected.
Restrictions on social and economic activities will be eased in prefectures no longer under the SoE. Venues such as restaurants, department stores, museums and movie theatres will be gradually reopened on the condition that social distancing measures are in place.
Prior to the announcement of the state of emergency, the authorities had already requested all people to avoid large gatherings and for those already in areas with an uptick in COVID-19 cases to stay inside their homes. While no nationwide directive to cancel events has been issued, event sponsors have been asked to consider whether events are necessary. It is expected that various public events and access to places such as entertainment places, national museums and sports stadiums will be suspended until further notice. 
From May 28, East Japan Railway Company (JR East) will reduce the number of regular services on the Tohoku, Joetsu and Hokuriku Shinkansen lines, as well as some standard trains, by as much as 50 percent. (The Mainichi, 20.05.2020)
