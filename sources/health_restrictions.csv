"Bahamas","","","Governance and socio-economic measures","Economic measures","No"," Ministry of Finance undertook to model assumptions on the likely impact of the Coronavirus over the next four-month period to mid-July 2020. Ran three scenarios – low, medium and high impact – based on assumptions of varying degrees of losses for tourist arrivals over a four-month period.Government has adopted a package of policy measures to deal with the tremendous economic impact of COVID-19 that is already starting to be felt as hotel occupancies have fallen, as cruise ship arrivals are on a 30-day hiatus, and as hotel workers are being asked to take unpaid or vacation leave. (Government Package of Policy Measures to Deal with Economic Impact of COVID-19).  $5 million government has already earmarked for healthcare response, and allocating up to an additional $11 million to cover detection, isolation, treatment and other COVID-19 mitigation activities. Government is allocating $10 million to provide for a temporary unemployment benefit, administered through the National Insurance Board, for self-employed persons working in the tourism industry. Government is making a special accommodation for those self-employed individuals in the tourism industry, given the unprecedented COVID-19 impact and will offer a sponsored unemployment assistance of $200 per week, for up to eight weeks. Individuals who are temporarily laid off because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 will be eligible for unemployment benefits, up to the regular 13-week period, if necessary","","2020-03-18 00:00:00.000000","Bahamas Information Service","Government","http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/gov/government/news/dpm%20turnquest%20global%20and%20domestic%20development%20as%20a%20result%20of%20covid-19%20will%20affect%20economic%20growth%20in%20the%20short%20term%20negatively/!ut/p/b1/vZbJkptIEIafxQ8gq4piPYLEDsWOBBeCRRsggRAtlqcfPOGJmR6Pu-dgizwR_Blf8FdmVq7j9X4d39Ln5ZT2l-aW1t_eYzpBQDZ5nmRNVqJ5oAZIQpTOI9mB6916r0SUUD7M01bcPcmK2ImZq1VsPZW99OaeHTNyvOjU4yaruS7s0oTTVsfD_aIY4UiFSSHEiZrUp7YkA0m5psQp20S1rpyJOw-ZMxlpfl4Ib9RdKGF8EFAqV9a5FdvyMkjyTpPaYWXGInYejs_nJdqTlfDUTrSLigO-nUpVReiOa8eurV10P4O8YkZeZ9XEK-TGbmJbVM937CSU14Sj7UTR6pxILGHddkmn4WOPqjgplv8ih7nse7jP4xb0TT-jOmVEVHdc8twOge5a-ZfFrGgxC_zk4cF7Ly3C54AKN5DWAwqwW_p7_geCP_Nly3Q2386CJr999rG6FW0kI_hZPvk_838u-LQW4vcSmQL0IrEN3mYUwiLBd8FHFn1sEvmZgF5Hi4D5uYBZ--s9IBOvnFp1rma3nB1g-qGK_WiGczA8qnmHfRHhPoX-NoIgCwYzeABzNlE_u9gvFLsI3UDgt_b2NL19DPQM8rVA1qdfDUQvBiLwaiDxaiD1YqD26ipFv74PtXV8ya5fh_z6FXylAIQEgixFIIZmiHWo5Sdq0_CDKG7dBzybNBh7nbxgQoyyixc3qtCPqq0QWb9PbMEhlXwaecfQraK4Fsdgp0jCCFuON51Aajeu8byrMtFoN8a93bLhXvJCJ2fXOhFmza64I5s3HNHRTabd4_3Mf_myxkpzPXziivBjZYNRN-fFla04ASMYvGAOFlcIs8D4UToT8EPNqyjNC0YT-w7R9_53VzZCTbrlZ9OJfi2QFeCrgcxvB-oEWoAGMjC7gZ6MXgxkf33RvGsllkMERzGAJVlIQQDXYRnR4_ahLr2Ek_MhqGTc5JmxGdlBrjeg82vR1fNamvz8eRSn9jrKPnPIBElb0bIVkjwfF3V6QKcdCA65HbzF5iZKeSfXgn7lOkSjG7xl2B3uNgPtiIlPsg8hK4IAK6uB34_evZCeYVoeGNepN50RYetYJI2v5KMZ1JFNMuz1ch4n7D9DvTV9L4yBEsNd4B2bx-pSxngbm5rRHQ80k3fXVT_1b-O_TZb9ECwmA971oANY5j_nFQbk3M_OuOwus1faexxU0Ct2EG9VBOaAwKWgLjNrMv3YwP3-u8kCKLTq8klnyuh3A2XKYpftjPFtniKW5Yt-NZD6XcC_NljLF75ZihSFpw1kifDVwF9_hu8vORJSFAcJjiYYgoHMOhyj1ZidnPNWdJPRQbWSemxh3WY-7jv1wpFLT_KCMRuoSJTLUxXo0MCp7lJK_5SOledy13ue720rhZ0B9-bILF2s5CmcHzJ5Uo0pk72cmtpgLKhkFu1HVM9n5mgiPNEtV3V3Uz40mD8A_4r5FgykJEgp79d04rfNxprikJ14HGxPTXWbROtSzTpoRIXn01ue7yIescp0zZUrNQSTPhKgNIBA36LHjmMpX707uniqZWpDn3KyeyMk2QvahMhGzt5VBwMq4TMY2ivc2Xjyj4-dmnKYcklvH5ZvyTw7Sc0ek4ccVfdu6yw3cnt96rpu0K54xD8Gma7-jmze_yOW6_wP69wzgg!!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/","2020-03-20 00:00:00.000000","BS","2020-04-27 00:40:26.851057"

The National Insurance Board has agreed to relax the requirement to visit the employment exchange at Warrens. The National Insurance Board will give those on short weeks 60 per cent of their earnings for those days.  For example, if a person is put on a three-day week, then the Board will pay 60 per cent of the wages the person would have earned for the other two days. For those employers who are prepared to retain three quarters of their workforce, even if some on short week, Government will defer their obligation to pay the employer’s contributions for three months, in the first instance, with the preparation to extend it for another three months if the crisis continues beyond that period. There will be a six-month payment moratorium on all existing loans and mortgages for persons and businesses who are directly affected and impacted by COVID-19.  Persons must go to their bank and work out those programmes.

Travellers will be expected to make plans for where they will isolate or quarantine in advance of arriving to Canada. Travellers who do not have an appropriate place in which to isolate or quarantine themselves must go to a place designated by the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada. These criteria are newly applied to asymptomatic travellers.","Not available","2020-04-14 00:00:00.000000","Gov. of Canada","Government","https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/04/government-of-canada-updates-mandatory-requirements-for-travellers-entering-canada.html","2020-04-22 00:00:00.000000","CA","2020-04-27 00:40:26.851057"
